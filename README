This is a slighlty modified version of Rogue 5.4.4 from the roguelike
restoration project. A few changes were made to make developing Rogue AI
easier:

	Linux build system replaced.
	Wizard mode fixed, enabled and extended.
	Some top screen message bugs were fixed.

Linux compilation instructions
==============================

Make sure GNU make, GCC and ncurses is installed. Edit config.mk and Makefile to
match your settings, and run 'make' to build the rouge executable and
'make install' to install it to your prefix.
